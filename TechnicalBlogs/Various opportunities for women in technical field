In the 1960s, women first entered the computer science and information technology fields in a remarkable way. 

A career path in technology can lead women down many paths and allow for continuous growth. In this field women can learn new skills such as coding and front-end web development, opening opportunities to job titles such as a web developer, IT manger, or network administrator.

Over the past decade there has been one consistency in the workforce and that is the steadily decreasing lack of female representation and leadership in the IT industry and STEM Fields.This means that there is a huge opportunity for women to pursue a career in a STEM-related field such as information technology.For the tech industry in particular the equal representation of women and men may still have decadeâ€™s worth of work left to go. As it stands just 19% of the tech workforce are women.

An interesting fact about women in tech is that the language used in a job ad as well as specific benefits aimed at women are both vital in making women to want to apply for a role.

Employee attrition at these levels presents an opportunity for women in tech who are willing to remain with their organizations, especially if they are able to distinguish themselves in their work, their experience, or their expertise.

Women in tech are primarily interested in data management and cloud computing. However, organizations should provide opportunities for women to take on high-investment priority and high-paying roles such as cybersecurity (currently, only 1% of women hold positions in this high-growth field).
